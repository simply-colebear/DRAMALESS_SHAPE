# Dramaless Shape 2.0

Dramaless Shape renders the Gen1Recomp overworld as a depth-buffered voxel
diorama. 
Version 2.0 strictly only provides voxel environments plus one legacy feature:
native Gen 1 2D battle cards staged on the voxel map.

This is an experimental split release based on the Dramaless development line.
Keep Dramaless 1.6.4 LTS archived if you want the former combined feature set.

## Features That Were Split From Dramaless Starting at v2.0

Dramaless now only handles voxel terrain, buildings, overworld figures, lighting, water,
shadows, camera modes, tilt shift, performance settings, voxel-map arena
rendering, and its native-2D card renderer. It does not handle Stadium Pokemon
models, replacement sprite packs, move animations, HUDs, disc stages, battle
transitions, or VR.

[StadiumBattleFX](https://github.com/anxiousintrovert/StadiumBattleFX) 2.x
now includes all the Stadium-related features that were removed from Dramaless. 
When both mods are installed, Dramaless registers `DRAMALESS_SHAPE:voxel-map` 
in the arena selector and `DRAMALESS_SHAPE:voxel-cards` in the model selector. 
The selectors are independent, so players can pair voxel cards with a Stadium 
arena or pair Stadium models with the voxel map.

Without StadiumBattleFX, Dramaless uses its own small standalone host for the
`VOXEL ARENA + 2D CARDS` option. The arena remains a fully depth-buffered 3D
voxel environment; only the Pokemon and trainer cards are 2D. It automatically
yields when StadiumBattleFX is installed so the two don't clash.

Mixed legacy/2.0 installs are blocked by manifest ranges. Use legacy with
legacy, or 2.x with 2.x.

## Installation

Install the release ZIP through Gen1Recomp's mod manager or extract it as
`mods/DRAMALESS_SHAPE`. This experimental build targets mod API 2 and declares
its required engine range in `manifest.json`.

## Voxel Companion API v1

This branch exports the read-only `voxel_companion` v1 provider for Kanto First
Person. The adapter runs inside the existing official `voxel` render pipeline.
DRAMALESS_SHAPE keeps ownership of `drawWorld`, terrain, actors, the base
camera, and the final scene canvas.

Certified extension seams are `background`, `opaque_after_terrain`, and
`translucent_after_actors`. This host does not advertise terrain patches,
shadow-pass extensions, or battle-pass extensions. It rejects descriptors that
request those unsupported seams. See
[`docs/voxel-companion-api-v1.md`](docs/voxel-companion-api-v1.md) for the
contract, limits, ownership rules, and test commands.

If the host detects the old `Ceiling.draw` KFP file-splice marker, it leaves the
file unchanged and does not export the provider. Reinstall a clean host copy to
use the API.

## Main controls

- `V`: cycle voxel camera modes (FULL remains an options-menu preset).
- `G`: toggle voxel grid lines.
- `T`: cycle tilt shift.
- `C`: cycle world curvature.
- `9`: cycle water rendering.

First- and third-person modes retain camera-relative movement and input. The
quality, shadow, antialiasing, water, day/night, grid, and curvature settings
remain available. `VOXEL ARENA + 2D CARDS` is shown when StadiumBattleFX is
absent. `BACK SPRITES` is available by default. It keeps the player's original 
back sprite in the UI while the enemy remains staged in the arena. 
The old multi-mode `3D-BTL` selector and all VR settings are gone.

## Performance And Optimization
Compared to the original DramaticShape, this mod strives to perform well
on most devices. For this reason, options were added (and more are being
worked on) that allow the player to lower the render resolution or render
distance.
These features are still being worked on and will improve in the future.

## Diagnostics

The Logging options is currently disabled to conform with changes to the
modding API. It will be restored later.

# AI Usage Disclosure
## What is NOT made with AI or AI assistance

***Any additions and edits that I (Stahltier) made to the Dramaless Shape fork myself***
***were NOT created or in any way touched by AI.***
**My code is all 100% organic home-grown human-made spaghetti, baby!**

However I acknowledge that many passionate people do not have the skills
yet that would be needed to tackle a project of this size, and I am grateful
for anyone who is helping contribute to it in any way they can.

I am not rejecting or disparaging creators who use AI in some way to
contribute to this project. But as everyone should be acutely aware,
AI can make mistakes that are very hard to catch if the person using it
cannot verify themselves what their AI is doing.

That is why I am making extra sure as the current maintainer of this mod that
any code that is contributed is at least looked over once and I test new releases
before publishing them to make sure nothing slipped by. It is very likely that
the entire foundation the code stands on was built by AI, which makes it extra
difficult to work with.

There can be hundreds of files with thousands of lines to review especially when
it comes to extensive changes for an update. That is why I will always prefer
human-written and human-documented code.

## Made with AI assistance (Terrarium, Battle Arts, StadiumBattleFX)

**Large parts of the mod's current code were written with the help of AI coding
assistants** (Anthropic's Claude, among others).

What that means in practice:

- The code was **directed, tested and accepted by humans**. Features
  were specified, measured, and rejected when the measurement did not support
  them. It is not generated and dumped.
- Much of it is **verified by probes rather than by eye.** The `tests/`
  directory holds twenty self-contained probes that drive the real game
  headless and write numbers to a log â€” shadow lengths, palette ramps, pixel
  classifications, frame-time medians. Where this README claims a number, a
  probe produced it.
- It carries the usual caveat all the same: **read it before you trust it.**
  AI-assisted code can be confidently wrong, and some of this is in the render
  path of a program you are running on your own machine.

### Contributions of and containing AI-generated Code
I will approve contributions by creators who use AI, but it may take longer
because of the quality and responsibilty standards I hold the mods I release
to the public to.
I am only human, and it is very easy to miss problems with AI-generated code
as it tends to be very convoluted and hard to read for a human.

If I become aware of faulty AI-contributed code, I reserve the right to roll
back the mod version, remove contributions, or even refuse further contributions 
from the same creator (if it's really severe).
